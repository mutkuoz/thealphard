### Hello World! I'm [Mehmet Utku √ñZT√úRK](https://alphard.tk)

Hello world, I am Mehmet Utku √ñZT√úRK, a young yet passionate developer.

**Summary**

With an insatiable curiosity, unwavering diligence, and a profound passion for the worlds of computers and mathematics, I embarked on a journey at the tender age of 9 that has since seen me thrive in various domains. My quest for knowledge and innovation led me to participate in esteemed events such as Kanguru Mathematics, International METU Robotics Days, and TeknoFest on four occasions, nurturing my interdisciplinary skills.

My portfolio includes a diverse array of projects, each a testament to my commitment to technological advancement. Notably, I contributed to the creation of 'G√∂n√ºl Tatlƒ±hanesi,' an international metaverse caf√© that celebrates diverse cultures, 'LoveSolutions,' a matchmaking software inspired by 'How I Met Your Mother,' and 'SoruBot,' a versatile AI-driven mobile application facilitating personalized study plans, test preparation, AI teacher model that is capable of giving lecture, and supports interactive learning.

Most of my projects are openly available on platforms such as GitHub, PyPI, and my portfolio website, showcasing my dedication to open-source collaboration. I eagerly welcome inquiries and connections via LinkedIn, Instagram (@the.alphard), Discord (mehmetutkuozturk), or email (contact@alphard.tk).
